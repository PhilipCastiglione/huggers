#User Stories
-------------

1. As a user, I can search for other people like me.
 - Ensure that searching allows sufficient filtering
 - Stretch: use an algorithm to show a match rating

2. As a user in a relationship, I can quickly access ways to chat with my partner.
 - User's menu options should replace flirt content with 'us' content
 - Us content should provide fast, immediately accessible contact methods

3. As a superficial user, I can see more photos of someone I am interested in.
 - Profile photos can be clicked on to redirect to gallery

4. As a privacy concerned user, I can change my privacy settings or delete my account.
 - Privacy settings should be obviously available in settings, a privacy statement should be available
 - Accounts should be deletable from the database at user request

5. As a user who has just found love, I can now use the app in my relationship, not search for more love.
 - For an existing user, updating relationship status should change the way the app functions, and what is emphasized on the app
