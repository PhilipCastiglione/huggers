#HUGGERS#
*Huggers; a patronising code name.*

##Mission
-------
Huggers is: a dating app themed around existing relationships, maintaining 
and gamifying relationships, promoting communication between 
existing partners and contextualising those relationships within 
friendship groups.

Huggers also: provides meatmarket functionality for people not in existing 
relationships, but more thematically focussed on people looking 
for romantic partners; the opposite of tinder hookups.

##Why?
----
- Users use dating apps to find each other, then the app is useless. 
if the relationship ends you need to take out the app again and dust 
off the cobwebs.
- To communicate with your partner you use your phone, text message 
or a texting app like what's app, facetime or skype, snapchat for 
safe photo-sharing etc. You also use these for everyone else (not 
special).
- This 'transformer app' serves a double life letting you get the most 
out of an app in both relationship phases.
- This app provides the place for relationship focusses social 
messages, which are annoying in other contexts (facebook feeds etc.)
- This app helps to gamify relationships and provide a place for a 
type of communication that sometimes is easier not face to face for 
people who prefer to avoid conflict, aiming to act as a relationship 
maintenance tool.
- We want a long term relationship with you too! This means we don't 
mess you about; we don't store your nudies on our server (just your 
public profile pics), if you clear a chat log so do we, your privacy 
will never be on-sold etc.
